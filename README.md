Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client from DriverPass wants people to get better driving training. He would like them to be able to practice tests and take online courses through a system. His company also offers on-the-road training for the students if they wish to have one. He needs a system that can function the way he wants and fulfill all these demands.

What did you do particularly well?
After this class I gained better in analytical thinking: Breaking down complex systems into manageable components and understanding the relationships between them. If you're good at identifying patterns and dependencies, this is a significant strength.
Problem-Solving Skills: Approaching system challenges methodically and finding efficient solutions, especially by applying logical reasoning and structured methodologies.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to go back to improve my UML class diagram. I think I can add more detail to it, such as some functions and attributes to make the system run more smoothly.  

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Interpreting the user’s needs during the DriverPass project involved active engagement with stakeholders to gather detailed requirements through interviews, surveys, and user stories. By understanding the core challenges faced by users—such as scheduling driving lessons, tracking progress, or accessing practice tests—the design prioritized intuitive navigation and functionality that addressed these needs. Tools like prototypes and usability testing ensured that the system aligned with real-world user expectations.
Considering the user’s needs is crucial in system design because it ensures the product is practical, user-friendly, and solves the intended problem. A design that ignores user needs risks being underutilized or failing to achieve its goals. For DriverPass, focusing on the user ensured that the platform would truly empower learners and instructors while delivering an efficient, valuable experience.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  Designing software begins with understanding user and business requirements through methods like interviews and use case analysis. Once requirements are clear, I would create models such as process flows and UML diagrams to visualize the system's components and their interactions. Choosing the right architecture, like microservices or a layered design, is essential for scalability and maintainability. Prototyping and iterative development ensure continuous feedback and alignment with user needs. In the future, I would emphasize agile practices, leverage design patterns, and use collaborative tools to streamline analysis and design processes.
