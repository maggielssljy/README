Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client from DriverPass wants people to get better driving training. He would like them to be able to practice tests and take online courses through a system. His company also offers on-the-road training for the students if they wish to have one. He needs a system that can function the way he wants and fulfill all these demands.

What did you do particularly well?

After this class I gained better in analytical thinking: Breaking down complex systems into manageable components and understanding the relationships between them. If you're good at identifying patterns and dependencies, this is a significant strength.
Problem-Solving Skills: Approaching system challenges methodically and finding efficient solutions, especially by applying logical reasoning and structured methodologies.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to go back to improve my UML class diagram. I think I can add more detail to it, such as some functions and attributes to make the system run more smoothly.  

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
